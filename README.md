# JARVIS · Claude Code Memory HUD

A local voice-and-graph front end for **Claude Code**. The brain is your own
`claude` CLI, so it runs on your Claude subscription — no API key, no per-token
billing. The memory is a folder of markdown you can open in Obsidian.

Nothing is hosted. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Quick start with Claude Code

Paste this into a fresh Claude Code session:

> Clone https://github.com/Itsme23476/jarvis-claude-code and set it up for me.
> Read SETUP-PROMPT.md in the repo first and follow it — it has the rules that
> matter. Short version: it runs on my Claude subscription so never use `--bare`
> and never set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; ask me for my Fish Audio key and put it in
> `.env` without printing it back; help me pick a voice; then start it and verify
> it actually speaks before telling me it works.
>
> One thing to get right: Fish Audio performs `[square brackets]` as delivery
> directions and never speaks them, so write JARVIS's lines to be spoken —
> `[dry]`, `[warm]`, `[lightly amused]`, or free-form like `[the calm tone of
> someone who has done this a thousand times]`. No markdown, no emoji, numbers as
> words, deadpan throughout.

## What it is

Two things fused together:

- **The HUD** — command matrix, live telemetry, action log, reactor core.
- **The memory graph** — every note in your vault as a node, every `[[wikilink]]`
  as an edge. Click a node and only it and its neighbours light up. Shift-click a
  second node to trace the shortest path between them.

The graph is not decoration. When you ask JARVIS something, the server finds the
vault notes that answer it, injects them into Claude's system prompt, **and
focuses the graph on the note it used** — so you watch the answer come out of a
specific file.

## Run it

```bash
./setup.sh
```

One command, safe to re-run. It checks you have `python3` and the `claude` CLI,
creates `.env`, takes your Fish Audio key without echoing it, lets you pick a
voice from the real library by number, plays the result back so you can hear
that it works, then starts the server on <http://localhost:8720>.

Skip the key and it still runs — you just get the browser's robotic voice
instead of a real one.

Already set up, or want the pieces by hand:

```bash
python3 seed_vault.py     # writes a sample agency vault (skip if you have one)
./start.sh
```

Then open <http://localhost:8720>.

Requirements: Python 3.9+ and Claude Code on your PATH. No pip installs — the
whole server is standard library.

## The vault

`vault/*.md`. Frontmatter sets the type, wiki links make the edges:

```markdown
---
type: client
updated: 2026-08-18
---

# Copper & Rye

Independent distillery. Won through [[Outbound campaign]] and
qualified with [[Lead qualification]].
```

Types drive the colours in the filter legend: `client`, `project`, `call`,
`note`, `concept`, `person`, `invoice`, `proposal`, `sop`, `brief`, `campaign`.

Point it at a real Obsidian vault with `JARVIS_VAULT=~/Documents/MyVault`. The
graph reloads from disk automatically when files change, or on `/graph`.

## Commands

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `/recall <query>` | search the vault |
| `/graph` | reload memory from disk |
| `/goal`, `/profile`, `/personality` | standing context injected into every turn |
| `/mission [task]` | mission queue |
| `/status` | runtime, model, vault size |
| `/new` | fresh Claude session |

Anything else goes to Claude Code with the relevant vault notes attached.
`Esc` cancels a running turn. `/` focuses the input.

## Voice

Ships mute — the browser's own `speechSynthesis` voice, which is the robotic
default. Add a Fish Audio key to `.env` and it speaks through that instead:

```
FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY=...
FISH_AUDIO_MODEL=s2.1-pro-free
FISH_AUDIO_VOICE_ID=612b878b113047d9a770c069c8b4fdfe   # Jarvis (MCU)
```

Find voice ids with `GET https://api.fish.audio/model?title=<search>`. Check
remaining quota with `GET /wallet/self/package`. `voice_setup.py` wraps both,
and proves the result is real audio rather than a JSON error with a hopeful
content type:

```
python3 voice_setup.py voices jarvis   # search the library, print ids
python3 voice_setup.py pick <id>       # write it into .env
python3 voice_setup.py say             # writes voice-check.mp3, checks the bytes
python3 voice_setup.py wallet          # TTS balance vs ASR credit
```

It reads the key from `.env` and never prints it — only a masked fingerprint,
so you can run it on a shared screen.

The key stays server-side. The browser only ever receives mp3 bytes from
`/api/speak`, so it never appears in devtools, page source, or a screen capture.

Verified against the live API: `POST https://api.fish.audio/v1/tts` with the
model as a header, `reference_id` selecting the voice. Speech-to-text uses
`POST /v1/asr` (multipart field `audio`). The bundled skills under
`.agents/skills/` carry the full contract, including the WebSocket streaming
endpoint if you later want token-by-token speech.

Swapping voices means editing `.env` and restarting — the value is read at
startup.

## Live voice

Click **Live** next to the ask bar and it goes hands-free: talk, stop, and it
sends by itself. An utterance ends after ~950ms of silence; anything under 350ms
is ignored as a cough rather than a sentence. The trigger threshold is calibrated
from your room's own noise floor at startup rather than hardcoded, so a noisy
room does not fire constantly. A level meter under the dial shows it hearing you.

Detection is suspended while a turn is running **and** while audio is playing, so
JARVIS never transcribes its own reply and talks to itself. Use headphones
anyway — echo cancellation is on, but speaker bleed into a hot mic is still the
easiest way to confuse it.

Tune in `ui/app.js` if the pacing is wrong for you: `SILENCE_MS` (raise to ~1400
if it cuts you off while you pause), `MIN_SPEECH_MS`, `MAX_SPEECH_MS`.

## Listening

Local `whisper.cpp` is used automatically when `whisper-cli`, `ffmpeg` and a
`ggml-*.bin` model are present — offline, free, about half a second for a short
clip, and it works in any browser. Install with `brew install whisper-cpp` and
drop a model anywhere the `WHISPER_MODEL` path points.

Whisper narrates silence — feed it a silent clip and the base model reliably
returns "you" or "thank you". Those artifacts are filtered server-side so live
mode does not fire phantom turns; `yes`/`ok`/`sure` are deliberately left alone
because they are real confirmations.

Two fallbacks exist and both have a catch. Fish Audio ASR (`/v1/asr`) is billed
from a **separate API-credit balance** to TTS, so it can 402 while speaking works
fine. The browser's own recogniser relies on Google's speech service, which
Chromium builds shipped without a Google key — Brave especially — reject with a
bare `network` error.

## Demo fixtures

`JARVIS_DEMO=1` (the default) intercepts a handful of scripted questions so a
recording is deterministic: the greeting, the agency numbers, competitor
research, and the campaign-replies chain. Matching is tolerant of speech-to-text
drift. Set `JARVIS_DEMO=0` to send everything to the real Claude.

## Configuration

All optional, all in `.env` — see `.env.example`.

| var | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JARVIS_PORT` | 8720 | |
| `JARVIS_VAULT` | `./vault` | point at any Obsidian vault |
| `JARVIS_MODEL` | Claude default | `opus`, `sonnet`, … |
| `JARVIS_PERMISSION` | `bypassPermissions` | full tool access, no prompts — see Security notes |
| `JARVIS_WORKDIR` | `~` | what Claude can see |
| `CLAUDE_CMD` | auto-detected | absolute path if `claude` isn't on PATH |

## On your phone

JARVIS binds to loopback, so a phone cannot reach it by default. The safe way
to change that is a private network rather than a wider bind.

**Tailscale (recommended).** Install it on both machines, sign in to the same
account, then from the repo:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg 8720
```

That publishes `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` on your tailnet and proxies
to `127.0.0.1:8720` — the server keeps its loopback binding and never touches
the wider network. Tell it which hostname to accept:

```
JARVIS_HOSTS=yourmachine.yourtailnet.ts.net
```

Restart, then open that URL on the phone. HTTPS matters for more than
tidiness: Safari and Chrome only grant microphone access in a secure context,
so Live voice works over `https://` and silently does not over `http://`.

**Same Wi-Fi, no Tailscale.** Cruder, and only on a network you trust:

```
JARVIS_BIND=0.0.0.0
JARVIS_HOSTS=192.168.1.50
```

The server says so loudly at startup, because JARVIS runs `claude` with
bypassPermissions in your home directory — anything that can reach the port can
run commands as you. The per-launch token still applies, but the token is
handed to whoever loads the page. Do not do this on cafe or office Wi-Fi.

Either way the Mac has to be awake with the server running. A sleeping laptop
is a silent JARVIS; `caffeinate -s ./start.sh` keeps it up while plugged in.

## Telegram

`telegram_bridge.py` puts JARVIS in a Telegram chat. It long-polls Telegram
rather than receiving webhooks, so there is no public URL, no port forwarding
and no tunnel — the laptop dials out. It only needs `./start.sh` already
running.

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:AA...        # @BotFather
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS=123456789         # @userinfobot, comma-separated
TELEGRAM_VOICE=1                       # also send the spoken reply as audio
```

```bash
python3 telegram_setup.py     # asks for both, verifies the token, writes .env
python3 telegram_bridge.py
```

`telegram_setup.py` takes the token without echoing it and without putting it
through the shell, so it never lands in `~/.zsh_history`. It checks the token
against Telegram before saving, so a revoked one is caught here rather than
looking like a broken bridge, and it trims a token that got pasted twice.

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS` is required and the bridge exits without it. Bot
usernames are discoverable and JARVIS runs `claude` with bypassPermissions in
your home directory, so an unrestricted bot is a shell with a search box.
Messages from any other id are dropped before they reach Claude and logged with
the sender id.

Delivery tags are stripped before the text is spoken, so `[dry]` performs
rather than being read out in the audio clip.

## Security notes

- Localhost bind, per-launch random API token, same-origin checks, bounded
  request sizes.
- **JARVIS runs with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` by default.** A
  headless `claude -p` can't show you a permission prompt, so this is what lets
  JARVIS actually use your connected tools (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, web search)
  instead of silently failing on every one. The flip side: it can also **send
  email, delete data, and run shell commands with no confirmation**, driven by
  whatever it hears — a misheard instruction can take a real, irreversible
  action. Set `JARVIS_PERMISSION=acceptEdits` in `.env` for a tighter blast
  radius (you lose unattended tool use), and only point it at input you trust.
- `.env` and `state.json` are gitignored. Never commit them.
- **Never add `--bare` to the Claude invocation.** It forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  auth and would bypass your subscription entirely.
- Your subscription is for you. Running this on a VPS for your own phone access
  is still one user; exposing it so other people can talk to it is account
  sharing. If you productise this, ship the code and have each person
  authenticate their own Claude Code.
